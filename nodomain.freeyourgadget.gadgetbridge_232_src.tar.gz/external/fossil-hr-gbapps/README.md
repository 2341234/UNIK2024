# Fossil/Skagen hybrids apps

## Introduction

The Fossil Hybrid HR (original and Gen 6) and Skagen and Citizen watches with the same internals support running apps that are written in [JerryScript 2.1.0](https://jerryscript.net/). This repository contains FOSS JerryScript code for these watches written by [Gadgetbridge](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/) developers.

More information about Gadgetbridge support for this line of watches can be found on [the wiki page](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Fossil-Hybrid-HR).

## Available apps

### Watchface

The `watchface` directory contains the code for the custom watchface that Gadgetbridge users can generate and upload to their watch.

### Navigation app

The `navigationApp` directory contains the code and assets for the navigation app that users can install on their watch from Gadgetbridge. This app shows navigation instructions on the watch from [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) (when enabled in Gadgetbridge).
